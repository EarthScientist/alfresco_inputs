# NOTES ABOUT INTEGRATING THE TEM GROUPS CHANGES TO THE ALFRESCO VEGETATION MAP
# All cells in the LandCover_iem_ALFRESCO_2005.tif file that were classed as 0 - No veg, were reset back to the original NALCMS values. 
# In this new file, cells classified as Cropland, Urban and Built-up, Water, and Snow and Ice were reclassified as 0 - No veg, 
# cells classified as Wetland were set to Wetland Tundra, and cells classified as Barren Lands were reclassified to Heath.
